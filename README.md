Gifted App


This is a mobile app designed for IOS using Apple's native language, SwiftUI. This project was built as a way to explore the processes of app development as a student and piggybacks off AWS's services like Amplify and DynamoDB.

Supports: IOS and IpadOS 15.0+

Significance:

This app is, although roughly finished, the project that I used to learn how to use Git, how to navigate AWS services and also work on UI/UX design. Undertaken as a passion project, this app is designed to mitigate the social awkwardness of trying to figure out what someone wants come giftgiving season. Designed as an app users can update as they find products
they would like, users can either snap a photo for quick add or import website links into the app. Although the Amplify services are now offline, breaking the authentication services
and social services of the app, the app still functions individually as an offline app if login features are bypassed. To test, feel free to download and build onto a device using Xcode.
